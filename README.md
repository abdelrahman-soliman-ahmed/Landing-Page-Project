- The element we need to work on is stored in a variable.

- The unordered list was used to add a list of items.

- Sections are associated with a list of items.

- A variable has been made that includes all sections

- Created Arrow function in the name of creatList, created within Arrow function
  forLoop work access on each section from sections to yours, is so that everyone
  section from those present uses it listItem is new in this way, we have achieved
  the idea that for each section of mine listItem it will be a front listItem and an
  inside listItem it will be in it innerHTML it will be a link to add in it Id a special
  section, so that when you click on it, it goes to the section, so that it is achieved
  that when you click on the section, it goes directly to it, and our guest why Id and
  data-nav and our guest class-menu-link because inside the css there is class-menu-link
  it was added listItem inside the Ul using the appendChild.

- The windo object was used, and a Arrow function was added to it, and the forEach was
  used in it, we had all the sctions that we have, and Arrow function inside the forEach
  was added parametar, its name is active and we used the if condition, and the getBoundingClientRect
  was used, so let's define the user on his screen on the section or No, and parametar was
  used as active, so that it came to the section and added that the top whose own is less than or
  equal to 160, and getBoundingClientRect the other active is added to it bottom and we
  added it to it is greater than or equal to 200, and if the two conditions are met in this
  case, the active class but not so class will be deleted.

- The Ul was entered addEventListener and it was added listItem so that with pressing on
  arrow function it will happen parametar and a section was added that is specific to listItem
  and a condition was created which is that if the data.nav is, we would have pressed it
  using the element in this case, it will go to me listItem it is our section and so if he
  pressed me he would go directly to her.

- And it was used scrolBy and our guest in it behavior : smooth even when i come to work smooth
  it goes smoothly, after that, it was used setTimeout so that when you press any listItem one
  time on the section, it is comfortable for the eye, and we wait for exactly 300 seconds and
  after that it goes to the section that was pressed.
